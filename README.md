"Temp-CO2_sensors" 

This embedded project uses the STM32F411 microcontroller to monitor environmental conditions in real-time. The system reads temperature and humidity using the DHT22 sensor and detects harmful gases with the MQ135 sensor. All readings are displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen. If gas levels exceed a predefined threshold, a buzzer is activated as an alert. The project demonstrates real-time sensing, output display, and hardware-based safety responses.
